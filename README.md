# location_shuffle

This is simple aplication made by python.<br>
I was kept in mind when working on making aplication four things.

①　this aplication is in composed of one label and one button.

②　when user push the button, it will shuffle the locations in randomly.

③　when user touch the button. The button will change the color.

④　this aplication use library called tkinter.
